Dear participants,
</p>

<p>
Welcome to this experiment and thank you for taking the time! This experiment is part of a student project in the Master's course Applied Behavioral Finance. 
</p>
<p>
Please read the instructions carefully. This experiment consists of two parts, one financial decision game and a
    questionnaire to collect data regarding your financial literacy. All the information in this experiment is true.
    Both the experiment and the analysis of the data are anonymous. For instructions on the other part of the
    experiment, see the sections below.
</p>
<p>
All parts of the investment game are relevant for your payout, therefore it is important that you understand the
    instructions. The experiment is expected to take 10 minutes. There is no time limit for this experiment, so if you
    need more time to read the instructions or think about your decisions, you are free to do so. At the end of the
    experiment you will receive a code that is relevant for your payout. Please write down your individual code.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the experiment, we use Experimental Currency Units (ECU). They will be converted into EUR at the end. The exchange rate is 10 ECU = 1 EUR. There is a 10% chance for each participant to be randomly selected for payment. If you are  selected, you will receive your payment via bank transfer. All participants receive extra credit in the Behavioral Finance course.
