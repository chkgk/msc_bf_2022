<p>    
This section consists of 10 rounds. 
 
For each round of investment decisions, you start with a balance of 100 ECU, which you can distribute how you want.
    You are able to invest in two different assets. This experiment is based on a coin toss. Each asset pays a different
    amount of Experimental Currency Units (ECU), whether heads or tails come up. You can allocate a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 ECU per asset.
    In total you have to divide the 100 ECU between the two assets according to your preferences. For example, if you
    invest 100 ECU in "Asset A", 0 ECU are invested in "Asset B". In total you have to divide the 100 ECU between both
    assets. For each decision round the sum has to equal 100 ECU in order to continue.

</p>
<p>
    
In each round, the payouts for each asset differ. You will see how much "Asset A" pays out in the event of heads or
    tails and how much "Asset B" pays out in the event of heads or tails as well. The payout of each project is
    displayed per 1 ECU invested. A graph shows you how many ECU are invested in each of your assets.
    
</p>
<p>
The payout of each asset is calculated from the following formula: 
</p>
    
<p>Payout (in ECU) = invested ECU x asset payout at head/tails.</p> 

<p>    
    
The coin toss doesn't happen until the end of the experiment, one of your rounds is randomly selected and a coin toss is
    generated. Your payout is then calculated based on this round.
</p> 
<p>
Your decisions have a direct effect on your payout, so consider your choices carefully. There is no trial round for this
    game. Once you understand this click on "Next".
